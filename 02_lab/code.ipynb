    "# Problem 1: Covariance - Josh\n",
    "- When given a data matrix, an easy way to tell if any two columns are correlated is to look at a scatter plot of each column against each other column.  \n",
    "For a warm up, do this:  \n",
    "Look at the data in DF1 in Lab2 Data.zip.  \n",
    "Which columns are (pairwise) correlated?  \n",
    "Figure out how to do this with Pandas, and also how to do this with Seaborn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the covariance matrix of the data. Write the explicit expression for what this is,  \n",
    "and then use any command you like (e.g., np.cov) to compute the 4 ×4 matrix.  \n",
    "Explain why the numbers that you get fit with the plots you got.\n",

    "- The above problem in reverse. Generate a zero-mean multivariate Gaussian random variable in 3 dimensions,  \n",
    "Z = (X1,X2,X3) so that (X1,X2) and (X1,X3) are uncorrelated, but (X2,X3) are correlated.  \n",
    "Specifically: choose a covariance matrix that has the above correlations structure, and write this down. Then find a way to generate samples from this Gaussian.  \n",
    "Choose one of the non-zero covariance terms (Cij , if C denotes your covariance matrix) and plot it vs the estimated covariance term, as the number of samples you use scales.  \n",
    "The goal is to get a visual representation of how the empirical covariance converges to the true (or family) covariance."

    "# Problem 4: Starting in Kaggle - Josh\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in this class, you will be participating in the in-class Kaggle competition made specifically\n",
    "for this class. In that one, you will be participating on your own. This is a warmup- the more\n",
    "effort and research you put into this assignment the easier it will be to compete into the real Kaggle\n",
    "competition that you will need to do soon.\n",
    "1. Let’s start with our first Kaggle submission in a playground regression competition. Make an\n",
    "account to Kaggle and find\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/\n",
    "2. Follow the data preprocessing steps from\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/apapiu/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/regularized-linear-\n",
    "models. Then run a ridge regression using α = 0.1. Make a submission of this prediction,\n",
    "what is the RMSE you get?\n",
    "(Hint: remember to exponentiate np.expm1(ypred) your predictions).\n",
    "3. Compare a ridge regression and a lasso regression model. Optimize the alphas using cross\n",
    "validation. What is the best score you can get from a single ridge regression model and from\n",
    "a single lasso model?\n",
    "4. Plot the l0 norm (number of nonzeros) of the coefficients that lasso produces as you vary the\n",
    "strength of regularization parameter alpha.\n",
    "5. Add the outputs of your models as features and train a ridge regression on all the features\n",
    "plus the model outputs (This is called Ensembling and Stacking). Be careful not to overfit.\n",
    "What score can you get? (We will be discussing ensembling more, later in the class, but you\n",
    "can start playing with it now).\n",
    "6. Install XGBoost (Gradient Boosting) and train a gradient boosting regression. What score\n",
    "can you get just from a single XGB? (you will need to optimize over its parameters). We will\n",
    "discuss boosting and gradient boosting in more detail later. XGB is a great friend to all good\n",
    "Kagglers!\n",
    "7. Do your best to get the more accurate model. Try feature engineering and stacking many\n",
    "models. You are allowed to use any public tool in python. No non-python tools allowed.\n",
    "8. (Optional) Read the Kaggle forums, tutorials and Kernels in this competition. This is an\n",
    "excellent way to learn. Include in your report if you find something in the forums you like, or\n",
    "if you made your own post or code post, especially if other Kagglers liked or used it afterwards.\n",
    "2\n",
    "9. Be sure to read and learn the rules of Kaggle! No sharing of code or data outside the Kaggle\n",
    "forums. Every student should have their own individual Kaggle account and teams can be\n",
    "formed in the Kaggle submissions with partners. This is more important for live competitions\n",
    "of course.\n",
    "10. As in the real in-class Kaggle competition (which will be next), you will be graded based on\n",
    "your public score (include that in your report) and also on the creativity of your solution.\n",
    "In your report (that you will submit as a pdf file), explain what worked and what did\n",
    "not work. Many creative things will not work, but you will get partial credit for developing\n",
    "them. We will invite teams with interesting solutions to present them in class."
